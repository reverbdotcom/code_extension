# Reverb Code Extension

These code extensions are designed so that we can collaboratively code together during an interview. Our guiding principal is: **we want to see you at your best** .

## Instructions

1. Choose the role you are interviewing for ( data / web ) and read the README there.
2. We'll use your machine to drive. Since the interview is conducted using a cloud-based IDE, you do not need to setup anything on your computer besides a web browser. If you don't have access to a computer, **let us know** and we'll arrange an alternative setup.
3. Familiarize yourself with the problem or the code.
4. That's it! We'll give you all other information during the coding session.
