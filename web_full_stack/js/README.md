JavaScript Code Extension
---
The JS Code Extension is a React application created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Tests are written using [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) manages routing.

# Setup

**During the interview, this application will run in a cloud-based IDE, so don't worry about running it locally. These setup instructions are purely for documentation purposes only.**

You'll need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed and a recent version (>= 10) of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to use this project. If you're using homebrew you can brew install both of those or if you want to manage multiple versions of node on your machine, we suggest using a tool like [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv).

* `yarn install` to install dependencies.

# Running/Tests

* `yarn start` to start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* `yarn test` to start the test suite.
