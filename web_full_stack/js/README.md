JavaScript Code Extension
---
The JS Code Extension is a React application created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Tests are written using [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) manages routing.

# Setup
You'll need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed and a version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) between v10 and v16, inclusive, to use this project. If you're using homebrew you can brew install both of those or if you want to manage multiple versions of node on your machine, we suggest using a tool like [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv).

* `yarn install` to install dependencies.

# Running/Tests
* `yarn start` to start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* `yarn test` to start the test suite.

# That's It
Really, that's all you have to do. If everything is running, you are ready! We will provide further guidance in the office.
