# Ruby Code Extension

This is the Ruby/Rails part of the code extension. Tests are written using Rspec.

## Setup
1. Install ruby 3.1.3. We like to use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), but do your thing, it's all good.

2. `gem install bundler`

3. `bundle install`

## Running the server

` rails s` will start a server on port 3000. You can then see the site at http://localhost:3000

## Running the tests

`bin/rspec` runs the test suite

## That's It!
Really, that's it. If you can get things to run, you are ready! We'll provide further direction when you come into the office.
