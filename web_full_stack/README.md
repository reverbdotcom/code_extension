# Reverb Code Extension

These code extensions are designed so that we can collaboratively code together during an interview. Our guiding principal is: **we want to see you at your best** .

## Instructions

1. Choose which example (Ruby, React, or Python) you would like to extend.

2. We'll use your machine to drive. During the interview, the application will run in a cloud-based IDE, so don't worry about running it locally-- all you need is a working web browser! If you don't have access to a computer, let us know and we'll arrange an alternative setup.

3. Familiarize yourself with the code (or write your own if you prefer) and make sure you understand how it works.

4. That's it! We'll give you all other information during the coding session.

## Words of Wisdom

1. Our implementations are not 100% complete or refactored in the best possible way. None of the code is gospel, so don't think you have to copy our style in any way. We're open to new ways of doing things as long as we can have a dialogue about it.

2. Our intention is not to trick you or test you; we want to collaborate. So if you have any questions about this, please reach out and ask!
